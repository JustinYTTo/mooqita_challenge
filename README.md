Challenge questions

Question 1
Exchange one of the images in the sample index.html and see if you can display that in the
browser. Did you need to restart the server to do that? Why or why not?
Answer 1
Restarting the server is not needed, just a refresh in the browser accessing the webpage is enough. The reason is that each cell in the table shown in the html file just points towards the location of the image file.  Upon exchanging the image links of, say, the first two cells in the html file (and then saving the change in the html file), refreshing the browser is enough to have it reload the html file and load in the images at their new locations.

Question 2
How can you look up the process ID of your server? Document the command line used and the output.
